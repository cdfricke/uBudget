"u-Budget" / "mu-Budget" / "micro-Budget"
$\mu \rm{Budget}$ is a lightweight CLI program which I have designed as an alternative to budgeting with Excel spreadsheets. The main user flow involves creating cash flows with consistent frequencies for predicting future account balances, investment performances, etc. Budgets can be saved and loaded from disk (stored with XML) to pick up where you left off.
